While the long and stressful academic year is over, consider working on your CompSci skills over the summer.  I'm currently reading a great book - "The Pragmatic Programmer" by David Thomas & Andrew Hunt - and they recommend a few goals for building and maintaining your "knowledge and skills portfolio": 

    Learn at least one new programming language a year
    Read a technical book each month
    Read nontechnical books, too
    Take classes
    Participate in local user groups and meetings
    Experiment with different environments (Windows, MACOS, Linux, IDE's, etc.)
    Stay current!
