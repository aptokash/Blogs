	<h2> 2021-10-08 Planning for the Next Semester </h2> 	
	<br>	
	  As you plan your course workload for the next semester, here are some tips and advice gleaned from my experience and some online
	  resources: 
	<br> 	
	<ul>   	  
	    <li> Consider taking a winter course.  Marist doesn't offer any CMPT courses over the winter session, but you could take an elective. 
		<li> Talk to other students to poll their thoughts on the different courses
		<li> If there are multiple professors teaching the same course, meet with them to get a feel for the teaching style and the 'fit'. 
		<li> Plan early!  Don't wait until the last minute to meet with your advisor.
		<li> Get up early and register for classes as soon as it opens for you.  Classes fill up quickly. 
	</ul>
	<br>	
	Here is some other advise, from  www.admitsee.com/blog/planning-ahead-picking-your-future-classes

	<ul>
    <li> Do your research. Every student has a transcript that shows credits completed, classes taken, and requirements that need to be fulfilled. Taking a look at this can help guide you and help you better see where you stand. You can then take a look at what classes will fit your requirements, and play around with what works.
    <li> Use Your Resources. Go to an advisor. Whether it’s a general advisor or one within your major department, take advantage of the resources on campus. Advisors can help you figure out what you should do next, since they’ve had so much experience with colleges before. They’ll also have access to the classes you’ve taken, and should be much more knowledgeable when it comes to what classes work.
    <li> Major track. On top of general requirements, your major is going to have necessities that you’ll need to fulfill. Everyone has a horror story about forgetting to take a class, or putting off your final requirements until senior year, just to have them not fit into your schedule. Plan ahead: whether or not you follow through with your plan isn’t the point. It’s just important to have a general guideline to follow. Map out your future semesters with the requirements that will be filled. It’s easier to picture your future than to scramble in the present.
    <li> Have a backup plan. Be proactive and have a backup plan. When you register for classes, you’re better off assuming that you won’t get into the classes you expected. If you sign up for four classes, have four others that fit into your schedule. When you don’t get into one or two of the classes you initially signed up for, you’ll easily have backups ready to go.
    <li> Overdo it at the start. A lot of students sign up for six classes, fully knowing they’ll only take four. Most schools have a registration add/drop period, so you can use it as a trial run for classes that you aren’t sure about. Like the idea of Astronomy 001 but aren’t sure whether you’d cut it? Sign up or sit in on the class and get a better feel for it. If you don’t like it, it’s easy to drop the class later that day. (But be careful on this!)
