	<h2> 2021-12-05 Advice and Tips for Finals Week  </h2> 	
	<br>	
	  Here are some tips for studying for finals. 
	<br> 	
	<ul>   	  
	    <li> Organize your study space to ensure it is comfortable, has good lighting, and has enough space for your books and materials.
	    <li> Create a schedule and game plan for how you will study for multiple exams
	    <li>  Find your most productive time for studying
		<br> &nbsp;	
		
		<li> Plan on getting enough sleep - cramming all night can be counter-productive
		<li> Take care of your body.  Eat 'brain food' rather than junk food. 
		<li> Take regular study breaks. Short study sessions work better than long crams. 
		<br> &nbsp;	
		<li> Find study buddies and study groups.  Learn by teaching others. 
		<li> Take advantage of professor's office hours!  
		<li> Find a tutor.
		<br> &nbsp;	
		<li> Focus on understanding the material rather than rote memorization.
		<li> Review your notes, as well as previous test, quizzes, and assignments. 
		<li> Re-read the book, highlighting the more challenging material . 
		<li> Use visual aids, graphs and charts. 
		<li> Use flash cards to regularly test your knowledge
		<br> &nbsp;	
		<li> Stay motivated. 
		<li> Don't forget to reward yourself for all your hard work! 
 	</ul>
	<br>	And here's a tip from the book "Your Brain on Music": Neurological research has also found that memory strength is a function on how 
		   much we care about the material. The more you care about the material, the better you brain will retain it!
