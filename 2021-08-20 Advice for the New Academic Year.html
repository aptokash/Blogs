	<h2> 2021-08-22 Another Academic Year is Upon Us</h2> 	
	<br>	
	  The fall semester is upon us.  I'm hoping for a return to some normalcy (even with the temporary mask policy). 
	  As you prepare for the new academic year, here are some tips and advice gleaned from my experience and some online
	  resources: 
	<br> 	
	  	  
 	    
	<ul>		
		<li> Review your performance in past courses to identify your strengths and weaknesses.  Make a plan for any improvements.  
		<li> Make a work/study schedule and routine that works best for you.  Are you a morning person or a night owl?
		<li> Find a method for testing yourself on new material. Many students use the Quizlet application.  
		<li> "Find a 'spot' in the library and let yourself get attached to it. When you go to study for a huge test,
              it will feel more like coming home than like sitting down to do work."
		<li> Learn to be an effective note taker.  Here's one resource:
                 https://post.edu/blog/preventing-information-overload-note-taking-tips-students/
		<li> Make sure your computer  has a data backup system in case of  problems or accidental deletions!  
		<li> Use all of Marist's available resources.  For example, the Writing Center offers many services, and you can join their
				ILearn site. 
		<li> Find another student in each course to be a study buddy. And acquire textbooks BEFORE the first class so you can
				hit the ground running
		<li> Be prepared to get to know your professors and use their office hours!
		<li> Start a journal!
		<li> And don't forget to keep a proper school/fun balance.
		
    </ul>
